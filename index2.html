      <h1>How to Recognize Spam</h1>
      <h3></h3>
      <h4>1.) The majority of spam emails look reputable at first glance, but fall apart upon closer inspection. Even if an email seems trustworthy, </h4>
      <h4>2.) Keep an eye out for grammatical errors. If the bank is confusing "their" and "they're" in an official email, think twice about clicking any link they send you.</h4>
      <h4>3.) Spam emails often try to convince you that something has happened to something important. Example:  They may say they’ve noticed some suspicious activity or log-in attempts, claim there’s a problem with your account or your payment information, or say you must confirm some personal information.</h4>
      <h4>4.) Law enforcement will NEVER call you threatening to arrest you over the phone, or ask you to submit money or information over the phone.</h4>
      <h4>5.) Phishing emails like to use generic greetings such as "Hello sir" to keep their net wide, since phishing emails are sent in bulk and not targeted to specific people. This doesn't mean they won't use your name, however.</h4>
      <h3></h3>
      <h1>How to Prevent Spam</h1>
      <h3></h3>
      <h4>1.) Don't click ANY links you don't trust. Not even the "opt out" link at the bottom. Attachments and links can install harmful malware.</h4>
      <h4>2.) Use multi-factor authentication where it's available. This makes exploiting your information more difficult.</h4>
      <h4>3.) If you get an email from a company with whom you don't have an account asking you to update information, it's a farce.</h4>
      <h4>4.) Back up your data and make sure those backups aren’t connected to your home network. You can copy your computer files to an external hard drive or cloud storage. Back up the data on your phone, too.</h4>
      <h4>5.) If you get a phishing email or text, it is best to report it. The information you give is incredibly useful and helps prevent scams from succeeding in the future.</h4>
      <h3></h3>
      <h1>Reporting Spam</h1>
      <h3></h3>
      <h4>1.) If you get a phishing email, forward it to the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) at reportphishing@apwg.org. If you get a phishing text message, forward it to SPAM (7726).</h4>
      <h4>2.) After forwarding to the appropriate location, report the phishing attack to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.</h4>
